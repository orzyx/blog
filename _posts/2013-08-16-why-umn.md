I'll be starting a new life in 2 days as a freshman at the [University of Minnesota (UMN)](http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/index.html). I've carefully chosen this snowy abode because of its high bang for buck: stellar data science professors, world-renowned engineering department and a significant scholarship.

To illustrate this point, I've created a bang-for-buck index (BBI) for all 31 American engineering colleges among the world's top 50 below.

The *Cost* data is from College Board's [Big Future](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/) for Fall 2013 and includes *Tuition and Fees* and *Room and Board* without financial aid to get a realistic estimate. The rankings are from the [Shanghai Rankings 2012](http://www.shanghairanking.com/FieldENG2012.html).

Calculating the BBI
---
Here's a formula that optimizes for minimum ranking and cost.

<script src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML" type="text/javascript"></script>

$$
\begin{align}
BBI = \frac{1}{cost} \times \frac{1}{rank}
\end{align}
$$

However, the 5<sup>th</sup> ranked university is **not** 5 times as good as the 25<sup>th</sup> ranked university, so let's modify our formula slightly. To avoid problems with *log(1)*, I've tied the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> ranked universities at 2 (sorry MIT).

$$
\begin{align}
BBI = \frac{1}{cost} \times \frac{1}{\log(rank)} \quad \quad \text {(Larger the better)}
\end{align}
$$

That's great, except for those tiny fractions that mess with our cognitive abilities. Let's flip the problem (literally!) by finding the smallest among the inverses.

$$
\begin{align}
BBI = {cost} \times {\log(rank)} \quad \quad \quad \text {(Smaller the better)}
\end{align}
$$

Observations
---

1) UMN is the highest-ranked sub-30K (my price band) university on the list.

2) Although Stanford, MIT, UIUC and UCB are expensive, the value is commensurate too.

3) Without financial aid, the Ivy League institutions -- Princeton, Cornell, Harvard, Penn and Columbia -- rank near the bottom of the list.
